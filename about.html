              Hi, I’m Mohamed. I'm a multi-talented human with a humble
              experiences in wide range of design disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experienced Web Developer adept in all stages of advanced web
              development. Knowledgeable in user interface, testing, and
              debugging processes. Bringing forth expertise in design,
              installation, testing and maintenance of web systems. Equipped
              with a diverse and promising skill-set. Able to effectively
              self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate in
              a team setting
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define
              myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality
              is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging
              myself, and do interesting things that matter
            </p>
            <p>
              Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily
              inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever
              they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit
              with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never
              satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost
              impulsive need to act on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests,
              hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast
              learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects
              and roles with relative ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course
              of my life and career. I currently work remotely with a selected
              freelance client base and are open for new opportunities
            </p>
            <p>
